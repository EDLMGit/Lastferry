# Last Ferry — repository guidance

## Objective

Build the current task in `FIRST_TASK.md`: one polished, playable 3D tutorial cove for a finite ferry puzzle story. The broader game direction is in `docs/PRODUCT_BRIEF.md`. Work independently through the stated milestone, including routine fixes and verification. Update `STATUS.md` with observed progress and material decisions.

## Read and preserve the project decisions

- Read `FIRST_TASK.md`, `docs/GAMEPLAY_RULES.md`, `data/first-crossing.level.json`, and `docs/FIRST_COVE.md` before implementing gameplay.
- Inspect `references/first-crossing.png` visually; read `docs/ART_DIRECTION.md` and `docs/ASSET_PLAN.md` before building the scene.
- General mechanics belong in `docs/GAMEPLAY_RULES.md`; exact first-level values belong in the JSON level. Explanatory prose and generated art do not override them. Resolve a material contradiction explicitly rather than silently changing a rule.
- Use the TypeScript/Vite/Three.js architecture in `docs/TECHNICAL_PLAN.md`. Keep game state independent of rendering and animation.
- Preserve user changes and any applicable repository instructions. Make routine implementation choices without repeated confirmation. Follow the user's current Git workflow and authorization for remote actions; never force-push.

## Implementation priorities

1. Clear and correct player interaction: action previews, one commitment per input, deterministic turns, and undo.
2. Recognizable 3D ferry, passengers, islands, and lighthouse; coherent camera, water, and lighting.
3. A complete rescue loop and a small satisfying arrival.
4. Focused tests and reviewable evidence tied to the actual implementation.

Code-built geometry is acceptable when it meets the art direction. Raw primitives are an intermediate checkpoint, not sufficient final art. Do not use a concept image as a background with clickable hotspots to stand in for the 3D game.

## Verification

The starter includes `node tools/verify-design.mjs` as an independent design check. It is not the game runtime. Build the actual reducer, controls, and renderer; test them independently and replay the supplied action sequences against them.

After creating the app, provide `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:unit`, and `npm run test:e2e` as specified in `docs/TECHNICAL_PLAN.md`. Run the checks relevant to the work. Once remaining concrete risks are covered, avoid redundant tests and speculative infrastructure.

Use the real interface for at least one complete rescue and one undo across a tide rise. Capture gameplay at desktop and phone landscape sizes. Screenshots support visual review; a state-only test cannot establish visual quality. If browser/device/video tooling is unavailable, record what is unverified and provide reproducible manual steps. Never fabricate a passed check or a gameplay capture.

## Code Review Rules

Flag preview code that mutates committed state; tide/flood event-order errors; passenger duplication/loss; partial undo; actions accidentally triggered twice; paths crossing land; inaccessible controls; misleading visual state; unsupported verification claims; and scope expansion beyond the task.

Prefer actionable findings with reproduction and consequences. Separate verified defects from visual preferences and untested risks. Follow `docs/REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md` and the review templates.

## Completion

Complete the M1 acceptance criteria in `FIRST_TASK.md`, maintain `STATUS.md`, and prepare a review record. Stop at the end of M1 with a clear result and any remaining gaps. Future chapters, progression systems, publishing, and a large asset catalog are later work.
